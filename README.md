## About the Video Course
	Go is one of the most powerful, efficient, and highly performant 

programming languages. Go is not only a powerful tool that can be utilized on 

the server-side but one that can be utilized on the client-side as well. With 

the power of Go and GopherJS, we can create feature-rich, client-side 

applications that run directly inside the web browser.

In this video course, we will provide deep insight into front-end web 

development using Go. We start off by covering the fundamental mechanics of 

front-end web development such as performing common DOM operations, accessing 

native JavaScript functionality, making XHR calls, rendering templates on the 

client-side, transmitting Gob encoded data, and communicating over a WebSocket 

connection. We also show you how to make your Go programs interoperable with 

JavaScript and how to read and write to the web browserâ€™s local storage. We 

then demonstrate how to create a Single Page Application by implementing 

client-side routing and directly rendering templates in the web browser itself. 

Utilizing the valuable knowledge presented in this course, you will be taught 

how to build GopherFace, a fully functioning Social Media website with 

incredible features.
